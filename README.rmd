# A Deep Learning Model for GO policy and value prediction.

This project aims at improving a given base model (a ResNet model, given in golois.py) that predicts GO games' policy and value.

All files except `final_main.py` were provided. The latter implements the improved model.
Initially changes of architecture have been attempted : Use of Bottleneck blocks (and ResNet B blocks) instead of simple ResNet blocks. The base model remains better.
Hence the retained model has the same architecture as the base one (in terms of used blocks) but is wider (larger filter size, yet within a constraint of a maximum of 10^6 parameters), is fine-tuned (mainly with the addition of Learning rate decay) and trained on larger batch sizes for more epochs.

**Note: Games data used for training exceeding github's file size limit, it is not provided here.**
